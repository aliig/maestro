  base: |
    Based on the following task, provide specific code changes or additions to address the issue.
    This may include complete refactoring and directory tree reorganization if necessary.
    Be concise and focus on the most critical changes.

    Task: {task}

    Repository structure:
    {repo_structure}

    Provide your response in the following format:
    - To create or modify a file:
      MODIFY: FILE_PATH
      ```python
      # Your code changes here
      ```

    - To delete a file:
      DELETE: FILE_PATH

    - To rename a file or move it to a different directory:
      RENAME: OLD_FILE_PATH -> NEW_FILE_PATH

    - To create a new directory:
      MKDIR: DIRECTORY_PATH

    If multiple operations are needed, provide each operation on a new line.
    For extensive refactoring, you can combine these operations as needed.
