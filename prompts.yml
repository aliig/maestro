    Review the following GitHub repository structure and provide the next code review task. Be concise and prioritize the most important issues. Your response will not be read by a human, but rather reviewed by AI sub agents, so you do not need to be verbose.

    Focus most on {focus_areas}.
    {ignore_areas}

    Review depth: {review_depth}

    Repository structure:
    {repo_structure}

    Previous review results:
    {previous_results}

    Additional instructions:
    {additional_instructions}

    Current file state and locations:
    {file_state}

    Please consider the current state and locations of files when suggesting modifications. You can suggest further changes to previously modified files if needed, but be aware of their current locations and states.

    Provide your response in the following format:

    STATUS: [IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETE]
    NEXT_ACTION: [REVIEW]
    TARGET: [Description of the next review task or file to focus on]
    REASONING: [Brief explanation of your decision]

    If no significant issues remain or the review is complete, set STATUS to COMPLETE.

  focus_areas:
    optimization: "improving code efficiency and performance"
    documentation: "adding or improving comments and docstrings"
    testing: "adding or improving unit tests"
    features: "suggesting new features or enhancements"
    security: "identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities"
    code_quality: "improving overall code quality and readability"

  ignore_message: "Focus less on {ignore_areas}."

  review_depths:
    minimum: "Provide a quick overview of the most critical issues."
    balanced: "Provide a balanced review, covering important issues without going into excessive detail."
    comprehensive: "Provide a thorough and detailed review, covering all aspects of the code."


sub_agent:
  base: |
    Based on the following task, provide specific code changes or additions to address the issue. Be concise and focus on the most critical changes. Your response will not be read by a human, but rather reviewed by AI sub agents, so you do not need to be verbose.

    Task: {task}

    Repository structure:
    {repo_structure}

    Provide your response in the following format:
    - To create or modify a file:
      MODIFY: FILE_PATH
      <PYTHON_CODE>
      # Paste the entire content of the proposed file here, including unchanged portions.
      </PYTHON_CODE>

    - To delete a file:
      DELETE: FILE_PATH

    - To rename a file or move it to a different directory:
      RENAME: OLD_FILE_PATH -> NEW_FILE_PATH

    - To create a new directory:
      MKDIR: DIRECTORY_PATH

    If multiple files need to be changed, repeat the above format for each file.
    If no changes are needed, explicitly state "NO_CHANGES_NEEDED".

    Remember:
    1. Always provide the complete file content for MODIFY operations, not just the changed parts.
    2. Do not use markdown formatting or code block syntax (```).
    3. Do not include comments about unchanged sections or use ellipsis (...).
    4. Ensure all code is properly indented and formatted as it would appear in a Python file.

readme_update:
  base: |
    Compare the original project structure to the new project structure after AI code review:

    Original structure:
    {original_structure}

    New structure:
    {new_structure}

    Cleaned changes:
    {cleaned_changes}

    Summary of changes made during the review:

    Based on these changes:
    1. Provide a concise summary of the major changes made to the project.
    2. Suggest updates to the README.md file to reflect these changes. Consider:
       - New dependencies or requirements
       - Changes in project structure
       - Updates to usage instructions
       - Any new features or significant modifications
