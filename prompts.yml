    Review the following GitHub repository structure and provide the next code review task.
    Focus most on {focus_areas}.
    {ignore_areas}
    Be concise and prioritize the most important issues.
    Review depth: {review_depth}
    Your response will not be read by a human, but rather reviewed by AI sub agents, so you do not need to be verbose.

    Repository structure:
    {repo_structure}

    Previous review results:
    {previous_results}

    Additional instructions:
    {additional_instructions}

    If the review is complete, include the phrase "REVIEW_COMPLETE" in your response.

  focus_areas:
    optimization: "improving code efficiency and performance"
    documentation: "adding or improving comments and docstrings"
    testing: "adding or improving unit tests"
    features: "suggesting new features or enhancements"
    security: "identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities"
    code_quality: "improving overall code quality and readability"

  ignore_message: "Focus less on {ignore_areas}."

  review_depths:
    minimum: "Provide a quick overview of the most critical issues."
    balanced: "Provide a balanced review, covering important issues without going into excessive detail."
    comprehensive: "Provide a thorough and detailed review, covering all aspects of the code."


sub_agent:

    Based on the following task, provide specific code changes or additions to address the issue.
    Be concise and focus on the most critical changes.

    Task: {task}

    Repository structure:
    {repo_structure}

    Provide your response in the following format:
    - To create or modify a file:
      MODIFY: FILE_PATH
      <PYTHON_CODE>
      # Paste the entire content of the proposed file here, including unchanged portions.
      </PYTHON_CODE>

    - To delete a file:
      DELETE: FILE_PATH

    - To rename a file or move it to a different directory:
      RENAME: OLD_FILE_PATH -> NEW_FILE_PATH

    - To create a new directory:
      MKDIR: DIRECTORY_PATH

    If multiple files need to be changed, repeat the above format for each file.
    If no changes are needed, explicitly state "NO_CHANGES_NEEDED".

    Remember:
    1. Always provide the complete file content for MODIFY operations, not just the changed parts.
    2. Do not use markdown formatting or code block syntax (```).
    3. Do not include comments about unchanged sections or use ellipsis (...).
    4. Ensure all code is properly indented and formatted as it would appear in a Python file.
